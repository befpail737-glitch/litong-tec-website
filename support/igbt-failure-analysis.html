                <h1>Top 7 Common Failure Modes in IGBT Modules: An FAE's Perspective</h1>
                <p class="article-meta">By John Doe, FAE | Published on: August 18, 2025 | Category: Failure Analysis</p>
                <p>Understanding why IGBTs fail is the first step to designing a robust and reliable system. Here are some of the most common failure modes we encounter in the field and how to mitigate them.</p>

                <h3>1. Short-Circuit Failure</h3>
                <p><strong>Cause:</strong> A low-impedance path across the DC link, causing massive current to flow through the IGBT. <strong>Prevention:</strong> A fast-acting gate driver with DESAT (desaturation) protection is essential. It must detect the event and safely shut down the IGBT within its rated Short-Circuit Withstand Time (typically 5-10Âµs).</p>

                <h3>2. Overheating / Thermal Runaway</h3>
                <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Inadequate cooling, incorrect mounting, or exceeding the module's power dissipation limits. <strong>Prevention:</strong> Perform careful thermal calculations. Ensure your heatsink is correctly sized, use the recommended type and thickness of thermal paste, and apply the correct mounting torque to the module's screws.</p>

                <h3>3. Over-Voltage Failure</h3>
                <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Voltage overshoot during turn-off, caused by parasitic inductance in the DC busbar. <strong>Prevention:</strong> Minimize the inductance between the DC-link capacitor and the IGBT module. Use laminated busbars and select a high-quality, low-ESL capacitor.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Gate Oxide Breakdown</h3>
                <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Applying excessive voltage to the gate terminal (Vge), often from ESD or a faulty gate driver. <strong>Prevention:</strong> Use proper ESD handling procedures. Ensure your gate driver voltage is well-regulated and clamped within the datasheet limits.</p>
